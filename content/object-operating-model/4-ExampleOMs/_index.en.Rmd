```{r, include=FALSE}
library(openMSE)
MSEextra()
library(MSEextra)
```

Existing operating models are available in the [Operating Model Library](/om-library/). The OM Excel files can be downloaded
and imported using `XL2OM` described [here](/object-operating-model/2-creatingom/#import-from-excel).

The OMs in the [Operating Model Library](/om-library/) are also available in the `MSEextra` package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# downloads MSEextra package from GitHub
MSEextra()
# load the MSEextra package
library(MSEextra)
```

The `avail` function can be used to determine the OM objects that are available in the R session: 

```{r}
# includes the MSEextra OMs
avail('OM')
```
