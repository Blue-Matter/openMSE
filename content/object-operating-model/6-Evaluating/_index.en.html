<p>The <code>Turing</code> function has been designed to evaluate an Operating Model against a <a href="/object-data/">Data object</a> from the same fishery. The function generates 5 random samples of Data from the <code>OM</code> object and plots these together with the corresponding data in the <code>Data</code> object.</p>
<p>Ideally, in a well conditioned OM one should not be able to visually detect which of the plots are the real data and which have been artificially generated by the operating model.</p>
<p>The <code>Turing</code> function takes an object of class <code>OM</code> and an object of class <code>Data</code>. It first plots the simulated and real data and then waits for user input before revelaing which of the plots are the real data from the <code>Data</code> object.</p>
<p>We use the <code>wait=FALSE</code> argument here so that each plot is printed without waiting for user input.</p>
<p>In this example we are using a <code>Data</code> object that was simulated using the same <code>OM</code>, so it shouldn’t be surprising that it is difficult to detect which of the plots are from the <code>Data</code> object (we haven’t included the plots here):</p>

<p>The <code>Turing</code> function is useful for evaluating if your OM adequately produces fishery data that appears similar (e.g as variable) as your real observed data. See <code>?Turing</code> or <a href="https://msetool.openmse.com/reference/Turing.html">function help documentation</a> for more information.</p>
