```{r, include=FALSE}
library(MSEtool)
stocks <- avail("Stock")
```

MSEtool includes `r length(stocks)` example stock objects. They can be listed using the `avail` function:

```{r}
avail('Stock')
```

These objects can be used together with the example [Fleet](/object-fleet/example-objects/_index_en/), [Obs](/object-obs/example-objects/_index_en/), and [Imp](/object-imp/example-objects/_index_en/), to quickly create an operating model:

```{r}
OM <- new('OM', Albacore, FlatE_Dom, Generic_Obs, Overages, nsim=100)
````
