<div id="linf" class="section level3">
<h3>Linf</h3>
<p>The von Bertalanffy growth parameter Linf, which specifies the average maximum size that would reached by adult fish if they lived indefinitely. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the same in all years unless Linfsd is a positive number. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="k" class="section level3">
<h3>K</h3>
<p>The von Bertalanffy growth parameter k, which specifies the average rate of growth. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the same in all years unless Ksd is a positive number. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="t0" class="section level3">
<h3>t0</h3>
<p>The von Bertalanffy growth parameter t0, which specifies the theoretical age at a size 0. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-positive real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="linfsd" class="section level3">
<h3>Linfsd</h3>
<p>Inter-annual variation in Linf. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. If this parameter has a positive value, yearly Linf is drawn from a log-normal distribution with a mean specified by the value of Linf drawn for that simulation and a standard deviation (in log space) specified by the value of Linfsd drawn for that simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="ksd" class="section level3">
<h3>Ksd</h3>
<p>Inter-annual variation in K. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. If this parameter has a positive value, yearly K is drawn from a log-normal distribution with a mean specified by the value of K drawn for that simulation and a standard deviation (in log space) specified by the value of Ksd drawn for that simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="lencv" class="section level3">
<h3>LenCV</h3>
<p>The coefficient of variation (defined as the standard deviation divided by mean) of the length-at-age. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided to specify the distribution of observed length-at-age, and the CV of this distribution is constant for all age classes (i.e, standard deviation increases proportionally with the mean). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="a" class="section level3">
<h3>a</h3>
<p>The alpha parameter in allometric length-weight relationship. Single value. Weight parameters are used to determine catch-at-age and population-at-age from the number of individuals in each age class and the length of each individual, which is drawn from a normal distribution determined by the Linf , K , t0 , and LenCV parameters. As a result, they function as a way to scale between numbers at age and biomass, and are not stochastic parameters. Single value. Positive real number.</p>
</div>
<div id="b" class="section level3">
<h3>b</h3>
<p>The beta parameter in allometric length-weight relationship. Single value. Weight parameters are used to determine catch-at-age and population-at-age from the number of individuals in each age class and the length of each individual, which is drawn from a normal distribution determine by the Linf , K , t0 , and LenCV parameters. As a result, they function as a way to scale between numbers at age and biomass, and are not stochastic parameters. Single value. Positive real number.</p>
