Objects of class `Stock` are a sub-component of the [Operating Model Object](/object-operating-model/).  

The `Stock` object contains the biological parameters for the modeled population. These include parameters to specify recruitment, growth, maturation, mortality, and movement rates. 

Users can specify upper and lower bounds for each parameter to account for uncertainty about the true value of each parameter as well as variation in parameter values over time, due to local environmental conditions, etc.
