<p>This section includes maturity parameters. The default parameters assume that maturation is size dependent and follows a logistic probability curve. However, age-based maturity or alternative length-maturity relationships can be specified using custom parameters.</p>
<div id="l50" class="section level3">
<h3>L50</h3>
<p>Length at 50% maturity. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. The L50 and L50_95 parameters are converted to ages using the growth parameters provided and used to construct a logistic curve to determine the proportion of the population that is mature in each age class. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="l50_95" class="section level3">
<h3>L50_95</h3>
<p>Difference in lengths between 50% and 95% maturity. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. The value drawn is then added to the length at 50% maturity to determine the length at 95% maturity. This parameterization is used instead of specifying the size at 95 percent maturity to avoid situations where the value drawn for the size at 95% maturity is smaller than that at 50% maturity. The L50 and L50_95 parameters are converted to ages using the growth parameters provided and used to construct a logistic curve to determine the proportion of the population that is mature in each age class. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p>

<p>Choose upper and lower bounds for L_50 and L50_95. Based on these ranges, the MSEtool will display parameter values for 5 simulations in the table. Click on any line of the table to view the distribution of values for that simulation in the figures below.</p>
