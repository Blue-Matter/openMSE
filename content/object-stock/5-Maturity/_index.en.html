<div id="l50" class="section level3">
<h3>L50</h3>
<p>Length at 50% maturity. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. The L50 and L50_95 parameters are converted to ages using the growth parameters provided and used to construct a logistic curve to determine the proportion of the population that is mature in each age class. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="l50_95" class="section level3">
<h3>L50_95</h3>
<p>Difference in lengths between 50% and 95% maturity. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. The value drawn is then added to the length at 50% maturity to determine the length at 95% maturity. This parameterization is used instead of specifying the size at 95 percent maturity to avoid situations where the value drawn for the size at 95% maturity is smaller than that at 50% maturity. The L50 and L50_95 parameters are converted to ages using the growth parameters provided and used to construct a logistic curve to determine the proportion of the population that is mature in each age class. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.</p>
