<h3>D</h3>
<p>Estimated current level of stock depletion, which is defined as the current spawning stock biomass divided by the unfished spawning stock biomass. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This parameter is used during model initialization to select a series of yearly historical recruitment values and fishing mortality rates that, based on the information provided, could have resulted in the specified depletion level in the simulated last historical year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers (typically &lt; 1)</p>
