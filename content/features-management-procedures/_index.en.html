<p>A key purpose of an MSE is to compare the performance of alternative management approaches, or <strong><em>Management Procedures</em></strong> to identify the method that is most likely to meet the management objectives for a fishery.</p>
<p>In essence, a Management Procedure is simply a set of rules which define how a fishery will be managed. These rules can range from simple harvest policies to more complex arrangements.</p>
<p>For example, a simple Management Procedure may be a constant catch policy, where the annual total allowable catch (TAC) is set a some fixed value. Alternatively, a more complex Management Procedure may involve multiple data sources, with rules that increase or reduce the TAC in response to trends in one or several indicators.</p>
<p>Management Procedures can differ in data requirements and complexity. However, all Management Procedures have one thing in common. They take fishery information and return a management recommendation.</p>
<p>To be included in an MSE, a Management Procedure must be reproducible and able to be coded in a set of instructions. While fisheries are sometimes managed by expert judgment, it is difficult to reproduce the subjective decision-making process in a computer simulation and include such methods in an MSE.</p>
<p>The MPs are functions of class <code>MP</code> that take an object of class <a href="/object-data"><code>Data</code></a> and return an object of class <a href="/object-rec"><code>Rec</code></a> which contains the management recommendation(s).</p>
<p>The first two arguments of an MP are always:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>x</code> - the simulation number;</li>
<li><code>Data</code> - a <a href="/object-data"><code>Data object</code></a> containing either <code>OM@nsim</code> sets of simulated data, or a set of real fishery data (<code>x</code> is always one in this case).</li>
</ol>
