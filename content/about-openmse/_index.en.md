openMSE is a collection of [R packages](the-r-packages) designed to make [Management Strategy Evaluation](what-is-mse) accessible for a wide range of fisheries.

blah blah blah, other stuff from old DLMtool User Guide introduction ...

Need to be clear here what the actual product is, and how it is related to the [Data-Limited Methods Toolkit](https://www.datalimitedtoolkit.org/).
