Real fishery data can be added to the `OM` with `OM@cpars$Data <- Data`.

You can learn more about this in the [Conditioning OMs with Data](/features-conditioning-oms/) section.

In the following sub-sections we demonstrate how to condition the observation model with catch, index, composition, and life-history data.
