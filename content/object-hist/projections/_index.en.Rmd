title: Running Projections

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(openMSE)
OM <- new("OM", Albacore, Generic_IncE, Imprecise_Biased, Perfect_Imp)
myHist <- Simulate(OM, silent=TRUE)
```


The projections can be run directly from a `Hist` object using the `Project` function:

```{r}
myMSE <- Project(myHist, MPs=c("AvC", "FMSYref", "Itarget1"))
```

Note that the `runMSE` function is a wrapper for `Simulate` and `Projects`, and:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
myMSE <- runMSE(OM, MPs=c("AvC", "FMSYref", "Itarget1"))
```

would result in an identical [`MSE` object](/object-mse).
