Objects of class `Hist` contain all of the information from the spool up period. 

They are created by running the simulations for only the historical period using the `Simulate` function, for example:

```{r}
OM <- new("OM", Albacore, Generic_IncE, Imprecise_Biased, Perfect_Imp)
myHist <- Simulate(OM, silent=TRUE)
class(myHist)
```

The `Hist` object contains all of the information from the historical spool-up period. This information will be used when the model is run in projection mode.

See the [Hist slots](1-contents) page for more details on the information stored in the `Hist` object.
