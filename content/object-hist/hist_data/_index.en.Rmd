The first slot in the `Hist` object is an object of class `Data`. This is the [`Data` object](/object-data/) that was created at the end of the spool-up period, and will be used in the first year of the projection period. 

Running an MP on `Hist@Data` will result in identical management recommendations as those in the first year of the projection period using the same `OM`.
