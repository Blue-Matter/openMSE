<p>The first slot in the <code>Hist</code> object is an object of class <code>Data</code>. This is the <a href="/object-data/"><code>Data</code> object</a> that was created at the end of the spool-up period, and will be used in the first year of the projection period.</p>
<p>Running an MP on <code>Hist@Data</code> will result in identical management recommendations as those in the first year of the projection period using the same <code>OM</code>.</p>
