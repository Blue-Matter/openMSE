Biological reference points are used to initialize the simulations (e.g. Depletion) and evaluate the performance of management procedures (e.g., $SB/SB_{MSY}$, $B/B_0$, etc). Although these terms are used frequently, the definition of biological reference points can be ambiguous, and there may be multiple ways of defining or interpreting them. This is especially true when life-history and fishing parameters vary over time. 

Here we describe how the biological reference points are defined and calculated in `openMSE`.
