The mathematical description of the `RCM` model is available [here](/tutorial-rcm-eq).

[Additional articles](/tutorial-rcm-select) describe set up of fleet and survey selectivity/catchability in the function call.

The [help file](https://samtool.openmse.com/reference/RCM.html) for `RCM` will provide more information on the possible inputs for the model, including the outputs from the function.
