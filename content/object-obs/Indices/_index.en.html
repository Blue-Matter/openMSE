<p>The parameters in this section allow the user to specify observation error and persistent directional bias associated with surveys or other indices of abundance used to monitor changes in stock size over time.</p>
<p>The “I” parameters indicate an index of abundance, while the “B” parameters indicate a measure of absolute abundance. Users may specify two kinds of sampling error to the simulated data: lognormally distributed observation error, and directional bias. If the MPs you are testing do not require time-series data you can leave these parameters blank.</p>
<div id="iobs" class="section level3">
<h3>Iobs</h3>
<p>Observation error in the relative abundance index expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV). Iobs requires upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution, and for each simulation a CV is sampled from this distribution. Each CV is used to specify a log-normal error distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation equal to the sampled CV. The yearly observation error values for the index of abundance data are then drawn from this distribution. For each time step the simulation model records the true change in abundance, but the observed index is generated by applying this yearly error term (plus any bias, if specified) to the true relative change in abundance. Positive real numbers.</p>

<div id="btobs" class="section level3">
<h3>Btobs</h3>
<p>Observation error in the absolute abundance expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV). Btobs requires upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution, and for each simulation a CV is sampled from this distribution. Each CV is used to specify a log-normal error distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation equal to the sampled CV. The yearly observation error values for the absolute abundance data are then drawn from this distribution. For each time step the simulation model records the true abundance, but the observed abundance is generated by applying this yearly error term (plus any bias, if specified) to the true abundance. Positive real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="btbiascv" class="section level3">
<h3>Btbiascv</h3>
<p>Log-normally distributed coefficient (CV) controlling error in observations of the current stock biomass. Bias occurs when the observed index of abundance is is systematically higher or lower than the true relative abundance. Btbiascv is a single value specifying the standard deviation of a log-normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation equal to the sampled CV. For each simulation a bias value is drawn from this distribution, and that bias is applied across all years. Positive real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="beta" class="section level3">
<h3>beta</h3>
<p>A parameter controlling hyperstability/hyperdepletion in the measurement of abundance. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Values below 1 lead to hyperstability (the observed index decreases more slowly than the true abundance) and values above 1 lead to hyperdepletion (the observed index decreases more rapidly than true abundance). Positive real numbers.</p>
