<p>The parameters in this section are used to describe potential bias in estimated biological parameters. Frequently, estimates of biological parameters such as growth or natural mortality are treated as known values when assessing stock status and determining the need for changes in catch or effort (also known as applying an MP). The MSEtool already allows users to specify the uncertainty in these values when simulating fishery dynamics by inputting ranges into the <a href="/object-stock">Stock object</a>, but with these parameters users can explore how bias in an assumed value (which are included in the user-supplied data object) used in a stock assessment procedure affects long-term MP performance.</p>

<h3>LenMbiascv</h3>
<p>Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling bias in observed length at 50 percent maturity. LenMbiascv is a single value specifying the standard deviation of a log-normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation equal to the sampled CV. For each simulation a bias value is drawn from this distribution, and that bias is applied across all years. Positive real numbers.</p>

<h3>Mbiascv</h3>
<p>Log-normal coefficient of variation for sampling bias in observed natural mortality rate. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Mbiascv is a single value specifying the standard deviation of a log-normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation equal to the sampled CV. For each simulation a bias value is drawn from this distribution, and that bias is applied across all years. Positive real numbers.</p>
