Other features of `openMSE` include:

1. Applying the management procedures to real fishery data to obtain management recommendations;
2. Building multi-stock and multi-fleet operating models (see `class?MOM`);
3. Conducting MSE for stock complexes, including modelling relationships between stocks (see `?multiMSE`);
4. Parallel processing to run the simulations quicker (see `?setup`);
5. Operating Model, Data, and MSE reports (see `?OMdoc` and `?Report`).

Documentation on these and more will be added to the `openMSE` site in the future.
