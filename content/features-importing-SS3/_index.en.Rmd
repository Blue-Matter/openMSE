## Introduction

`openMSE` includes several functions for importing operating models and fishery data from Stock Synthesis 3 models.

We demonstrate importing from SS3 using the Simple example available in the [SS Document Library](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/document-library/-/document_library/0LmuycloZeIt/view/11684741?_com_liferay_document_library_web_portlet_DLPortlet_INSTANCE_0LmuycloZeIt_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fvlab.noaa.gov%3A443%2Fweb%2Fstock-synthesis%2Fdocument-library%2F-%2Fdocument_library%2F0LmuycloZeIt%2Fview%2F856180). 

To reproduce the examples in the following sub-pages, download the SS3 files from the Simple example to your machine and run the SS3 executable to produce the SS3 output.
