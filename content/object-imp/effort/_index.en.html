<p>This section includes parameters describing the management agencyâ€™s ability to implement an MP that institutes an effort limit (TAE). For example, an MP may specify a certain TAE, but the managing agency may be unable to stop fishing at the exact moment that the effort limit is reached, resulting in underages or overages.</p>
<p>TAEFrac and TAESD allow the user to specify the actual effort employed as a fraction of the desired TAE in the form of a distribution that allows variability between simulations and years.</p>
<div id="taefrac" class="section level3">
<h3>TAEFrac</h3>
<p>Mean fraction of recommended TAE that is actually taken. For each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the mean TAE fraction obtained across all years of that simulation, and a yearly TAE frac is drawn from a log-normal distribution with the simulation mean and a coefficient of variation specified by the value of TAESD drawn for that simulation. If the value drawn is greater than 1 the amount of effort employed is greater than that recommended by the TAE, and if it is less than 1 the amount of effort employed is less than that recommended by the TAE. Positive real numbers.</p>

<div id="taesd" class="section level3">
<h3>TAESD</h3>
<p>Log-normal coefficient of variation in the fraction of recommended TAE that is actually taken. For each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is used, along with the TAEFrac drawn for that simulation, to create a log-normal distribution that yearly values speciying the actual amount of efort employed are drawn from. Positive real numbers.</p>
