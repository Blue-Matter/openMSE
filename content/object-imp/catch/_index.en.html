<p>This section includes parameters describing the management agencyâ€™s ability to implement an MP that institutes a catch limit (TAC). For example, an MP may specify a certain TAC, but the managing agency may be unable to stop fishing at the exact moment that the quota is obtained, resulting in quota underages or overages.</p>
<p>TACFrac and TACSD allow the user to specify the actual catches that are taken as a fraction of the desired TAC in the form of a distribution that allows variability between simulations and years.</p>
<div id="tacfrac" class="section level3">
<h3>TACFrac</h3>
<p>Mean fraction of recommended TAC that is actually taken. For each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the mean TAC fraction obtained across all years of that simulation, and a yearly TAC frac is drawn from a log-normal distribution with the simulation mean and a coefficient of variation specified by the value of TACSD drawn for that simulation. If the value drawn is greater than 1 the amount of catch taken is greater than that recommended by the TAC, and if it is less than 1 the amount of catch taken is less than that recommended by the TAC. Positive real numbers.</p>

<div id="tacsd" class="section level3">
<h3>TACSD</h3>
<p>Log-normal coefficient of variation in the fraction of recommended TAC that is actually taken. For each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is used, along with the TACFrac drawn for that simulation, to create a log-normal distribution that yearly values specifying the actual amount of catch taken are drawn from. Positive real numbers.</p>
