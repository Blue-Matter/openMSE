<p>This section includes parameters describing the management agencyâ€™s ability to implement an MP that institutes an size limit. For example, an MP may specify a certain size limit, but the managing agency may be unable to limit all take of undersized fish.</p>
<p>SizeLimFrac and SizeLimSD allow the user to specify the actual size of fish retained as a fraction of the desired size limit in the form of a distribution that allows variability between simulations and years.</p>
<div id="sizelimfrac" class="section level3">
<h3>SizeLimFrac</h3>
<p>Mean fraction of recommended size limit that is actually retained. For each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the mean size limit fraction obtained across all years of that simulation, and a yearly size limit fraction is drawn from a log-normal distribution with the simulation mean and a coefficient of variation specified by the value of SizeLimSD drawn for that simulation. If the value drawn is greater than 1 the size of fish retained is greater than that recommended by the size limit, and if it is less than 1 the amount of size of fish retained is less than that recommended by the size limit. Positive real numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="sizelimsd" class="section level3">
<h3>SizeLimSD</h3>
<p>Log-normal coefficient of variation in the fraction of recommended size limit that is actually retained. For each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is used, along with the SizeLimFrac drawn for that simulation, to create a log-normal distribution that yearly values speciying the actual fraction of the size limit retained are drawn from. Positive real numbers.</p>
