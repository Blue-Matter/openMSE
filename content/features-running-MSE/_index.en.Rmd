This section provides a brief overview of running a management strategy evaluation (MSE) with `openMSE`.

Running a MSE in `openMSE` requires two components:

1. An [Operating Model](/object-operating-model/) that describes the characteristics of the fishery, including [stock](/object-stock/) and [fleet](/object-fleet/) dynamics, the [observation](/object-obs/) process (i.e., sampling of the data), and [implementation](/object-imp/) of the management advice.

1. A set of candidate [management procedures](/features-management-procedures/) that will tested in the MSE.
