```{r, include=FALSE}
library(openMSE)
```

`openMSE` includes a [large range of management procedures](/features-management-procedures/builtin/) that can be evaluated in the MSE. Users can also develop their own [custom MPs](/features-management-procedures/custommps/) for testing within the framework.

We'll use a couple of MPs from the [`DLMtool` package](/welcome-about-openmse/the-r-packages/) as an example:

```{r}
MPs <- c('AvC', 'DCAC', 'Iratio', 'Ltarget1', 'YPR')
```
