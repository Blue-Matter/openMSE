```{r, include=FALSE}
library(openMSE)
```

`openMSE` is designed to be flexible and extensible. Users create [fully customized](/features-custom-parameters/) operating models, or [import operating models from stock assessments](/om-data-rich/).

`openMSE` includes a [library](/om-library/) of existing operating models that can be used or modified, as well as a range of [example](/object-stock/8-example-stock-objects/_index_en/) OM components for quickly building operating models. 

The OMs in the [OM library](/om-library/) are available in the `MSEextra` package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# download MSEextra from Github
MSEextra()
```

We'll use the `Lane_Snapper_GOM_NOAA` OM from `MSEextra` as an example:
```{r}
library(MSEextra)
OM <- Lane_Snapper_GOM_NOAA
```
