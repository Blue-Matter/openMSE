#### Bug Reports
The `openMSE` packages are subject to ongoing development and testing. If you find a bug or a problem with the code, please create an issue on GitHub for the relevant package: [MSEtool](https://github.com/Blue-Matter/MSEtool/issues/new), [DLMtool](https://github.com/Blue-Matter/DLMtool/issues/new),  [SAMtool](https://github.com/Blue-Matter/SAMtool/issues/new).

Please provide a [reproducible example](https://gist.github.com/hadley/270442) so that we can recreate the problem and fix it.

Please also note that GitHub issues should be restricted to bugs or situations where the code doesn't appear to be working as expected. While we'll try to help out where we can, in most cases we will be unable to provide advice for specific applications of the `openMSE` packages.  


#### Training, Consulting, and Collaborations
We offer training courses and workshops for the `openMSE` software, as well as a broad range of topics including R programming, simulation modeling, stock assessment, and management strategy evaluation.

We are also happy to work with you to construct and condition operating models, develop custom management procedures, and conduct management strategy evaluation.
