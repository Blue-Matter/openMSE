```{r, include=FALSE}
library(MSEtool)

```

### Plots in R Console
The generic `plot` function can be used to visualize the data in a `Data` object. By default, `plot` waits for user input before displaying the next plot (this option can be switched off using `wait=FALSE`):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(Cobia) 
```

### Data Report
A Data object can be combined with a Data Documentation File to produce a fully documented data report. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Report(Data, "Data.md") # assuming Data.md is in the working directory.
```

See the [Populating the Fishery Object section](/tutorial-populating-data/) for more details on populating the Data Documentation File and type `?Report` in the R console for more information on the `Report` function.
