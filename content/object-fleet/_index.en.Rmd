Objects of class `Fleet` are a sub-component of the [Operating Model Object](/operating-model-object/). 

The Fleet Object includes parameters that specify what is known about historical fishing effort as well as the likelihood of future changes in gear efficiency (catchability). This section also includes information on the selection and retention of the fishing gear, as well as any spatial closures.
