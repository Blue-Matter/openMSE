<div id="catch-at-age" class="section level3">
<h3>Catch at age</h3>
<p>The catch (in numbers) <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> at age for fleet <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[ C_{y,a,f} = \dfrac{v_{y,a,f} F_{y,f}}{Z_{y,a}} N_{y,a} (1 - \exp[-Z_{y,a}]).\]</span></p>
<p>If the model is conditioned on catch, then <span class="math inline">\(F_{y,f}\)</span> can be estimated as parameters or solved iteratively to match the observed catch. If the model is conditioned on effort, then
<span class="math display">\[ F_{y,f} = q_f E_{y,f},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(E_{y,f}\)</span> is the observed effort and <span class="math inline">\(q_f\)</span> is the scaling coefficient.</p>
<p>The proportion of the catch-at-age is
<span class="math display">\[ p_{y,a,f} = \dfrac{C_{y,a,f}}{\sum_a C_{y,a,f}}.\]</span></p>

<div id="catch-at-length" class="section level3">
<h3>Catch at length</h3>
<p>The catch at length is calculated assuming a normally distributed length-at-age <span class="math inline">\(P(\ell,a)\)</span>, where

      1 -\phi(L&#39;_\ell) &amp; \ell = L
\end{cases}
\]</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(L&#39;_{\ell}\)</span> as the length at the lower boundary of length bin <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi(L&#39;_{\ell})\)</span> as the cumulative distribution function of a normal variable with mean <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{L}_{y,a}\)</span> (the expected mean length at age <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>) and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{L}_{y,a} \times CV^L\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(CV^L\)</span> is the coefficient of variation in mean length at age).</p>
