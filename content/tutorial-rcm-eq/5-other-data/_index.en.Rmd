### Catch in weight
The catch in weight $Y$ is
$$ Y_{y,f} = \sum_a C_{y,a,f} w_{y,a}.$$

### Mean size
The mean length of the catch $\bar{L}_{y,f}$ is
$$ \bar{L}_{y,f} = \dfrac{\sum_{\ell} L_{\ell} C_{y,\ell,f}}{\sum_{\ell} C_{y,\ell,f}},$$
where $L_\ell$ is the midpoint of the length bin $\ell$.

The mean weight of the catch $\bar{w}_{y,f}$ is
$$ \bar{w}_{y,f} = \dfrac{\sum_a C_{y,a,f}w_{y,a}}{\sum_a C_{y,a,f}},$$

### Index
If the $s^{\textrm{th}}$ index is biomass-based, then the index $I_{y,s}$ is calculated as
$$ I_{y,s} = q_s \sum_a v_{y,a,s} N_{y,a} w_{y,a}, $$
where $q$ is the scaling coefficient and $s$ indexes the survey.

If the index is abundance-based, then 
$$ I_{y,s} = q_s \sum_a v_{y,a,s} N_{y,a} . $$

The proportion-at-age vulnerable to the index is
$$ p_{y,a,s} = \dfrac{v_{a,s}N_{y,a}}{\sum_a v_{a,s}N_{y,a}}.$$


The proportion-at-length vulnerable to the index is
$$ p_{y,\ell,s} = \dfrac{\sum_a v_{a,s} N_{y,a} P(\ell|a)}{\sum_{\ell} \sum_a v_{a,s} N_{y,a} P(\ell|a)}.$$
