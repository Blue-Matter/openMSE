<div id="fleet-selectivity" class="section level3">
<h3>Fleet selectivity</h3>
<p>For fleets, selectivity is defined by blocks (indexed by <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>) which can then be assigned to any fleet <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and year <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to allow for time-varying selectivity. By default, each fleet is assigned to its own block for all years (no time-varying selectivity).</p>
<p>For flat-topped selectivity in block <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, two parameters are used and expressed in terms of length units: the length of 5% selectivity (<span class="math inline">\(L^5_b\)</span>) and the length of full selectivity <span class="math inline">\(L^{\textrm{FS}}_b\)</span>.</p>
<p>For dome selectivity, a third parameter, the selectivity at <span class="math inline">\(L_{\infty}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V^{L_{\infty}}_b\)</span> is also used. Length-based selectivity is converted to age-based selectivity in the age-structured model as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ v_{y,a,b} = 
\begin{cases}
2^{-[(L_{y,a} - L^{\textrm{FS}}_b)/(\sigma^{\textrm{asc}}_b)]^2} &amp; \textrm{if } L_{y,a} &lt; L^{\textrm{FS}}_b\\ 
1 &amp; \textrm{if logistic and } L_{y,a} \ge L^{\textrm{FS}}_b,\\
2^{-[(L_{y,a} - L^{\textrm{FS}}_b)/(\sigma^{\textrm{des}}_b)]^2} &amp; \textrm{if dome and } L_{y,a} \ge L^{\textrm{FS}}_b
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(L_{y,a}\)</span> is the mean length-at-age and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{\textrm{asc}}_b = (L^5_b - L^{\textrm{FS}}_b)/\sqrt{-\log_2(0.05)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{\textrm{des}}_b = (L_{\infty} - L^{\textrm{FS}}_b)/\sqrt{-\log_2(V^{L_{\infty}}_b)}\)</span> control the shape of the ascending and descending limbs, respectively, of the selectivity function.</p>
<p>In this parameterization, length-based selectivity is constant over time. The corresponding age-based selectivity within each block is constant so long as growth is not time-varying.</p>
<p>Selectivity can also be parameterized where <span class="math inline">\(v_{y,a,b}\)</span> are free independent parameters. In this case, selectivity does not vary among years.</p>
<p>Total mortality <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> in year <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and for age <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the sum of fishing mortality <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> from all fleets and natural mortality <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Z_{y,a} = M_{y,a} + \sum_f v_{y,a,f} F_{y,f},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(v_{y,a,f}\)</span> is the fleet selectivity after assigning blocks to fleets.</p>
</div>
<div id="index-selectivity" class="section level3">
<h3>Index selectivity</h3>
<p>Index selectivity is constant over time and is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(v_{a,s}\)</span>, using either logistic, dome, or free parameterizations.</p>
