After setting the equilibrium population age distribution in the first year of the model, the population abundance $N_{y,a}$ in subsequent years is
$$ N_{y,a} =
\begin{cases}
      R_y \exp(\delta_y - 0.5 \tau^2) & a = 0\\
      N_{y-1,a-1} \exp(-Z_{y-1,a-1}) & a = 1, \ldots, A - 1,\\
      N_{y-1,a-1} \exp(-Z_{y-1,a-1}) + N_{y-1,a} \exp(-Z_{y-1,a}) & a = A
\end{cases}
$$
where $R_y$ is the recruitment, $\delta_y$ are recruitment deviates, and $A$ is the maximum-age as the plus-group.

Recruitment is modelled as
$$ R_y = 
\begin{cases}
      \dfrac{\alpha^{\textrm{B}} B^S_{y-1}}{1 + \beta^{\textrm{B}}B^S_{y-1}} & \textrm{if Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship}\\
      \alpha^{\textrm{R}} B^S_{y-1} \exp(-\beta^{\textrm{R}} B^S_{y-1})& \textrm{if Ricker stock-recruit relationship}
\end{cases}.
$$

The spawning biomass is $B^S_y$ is
$$B^S_y = \sum_a f_{y,a} m_{y,a} N_{y,a} \exp(-\Delta \times Z_{y,a}),$$
where $m_{y,a}$ and $f_{y,a}$ are the maturity at age and fecundity at age, respectively, and $\Delta$ is the spawn timing, the elapsed fraction of the year that elapses when spawning occurs, e.g., $\Delta = 0.5$ is the midpoint of the year.
