After setting the equilibrium population age distribution in the first year of the model, the population abundance $N_{y,a}$ in subsequent years is
$$ N_{y,a} =
\begin{cases}
      R_y & a = 1\\
      N_{y-1,a-1} \exp(-Z_{y-1,a-1}) & a = 2, \ldots, A - 1,\\
      N_{y-1,a-1} \exp(-Z_{y-1,a-1}) + N_{y-1,a} \exp(-Z_{y-1,a}) & a = A
\end{cases}
$$
where $R_y$ is the recruitment and $A$ is the maximum-age as the plus-group.

Recruitment is modelled as
$$ R_y = 
\begin{cases}
      \dfrac{\alpha^{\textrm{B}} B^S_{y-1}}{1 + \beta^{\textrm{B}}B^S_{y-1}} \exp(\delta_y - 0.5 \tau^2) & \textrm{if Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship}\\
      \alpha^{\textrm{R}} B^S_{y-1} \exp(-\beta^{\textrm{R}} B^S_{y-1})\exp(\delta_y - 0.5 \tau^2) & \textrm{if Ricker stock-recruit relationship}
\end{cases},
$$
where $\delta_y$ are recruitment deviates.

The spawning biomass is $B^S_y$ is
$$B^S_y = \sum_a w_{y,a} m_{y,a} N_{y,a},$$
where $m_{y,a}$ and $w_{y,a}$ are the maturity at age and weight at age, respectively.
