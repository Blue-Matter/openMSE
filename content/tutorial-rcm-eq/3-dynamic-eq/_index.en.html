<p>After setting the equilibrium population age distribution in the first year of the model, the population abundance <span class="math inline">\(N_{y,a}\)</span> in subsequent years is
<span class="math display">\[ N_{y,a} =
\begin{cases}
      R_y &amp; a = 1\\
      N_{y-1,a-1} \exp(-Z_{y-1,a-1}) &amp; a = 2, \ldots, A - 1,\\
      N_{y-1,a-1} \exp(-Z_{y-1,a-1}) + N_{y-1,a} \exp(-Z_{y-1,a}) &amp; a = A
\end{cases}
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(R_y\)</span> is the recruitment and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the maximum-age as the plus-group.</p>
<p>Recruitment is modelled as
<span class="math display">\[ R_y = 
\begin{cases}
      \dfrac{\alpha^{\textrm{BH}} B^S_{y-1}}{1 + \beta^{\textrm{BH}}B^S_{y-1}} \exp(\delta_y - 0.5 \tau^2) &amp; \textrm{if Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship}\\
      \alpha^{\textrm{Ricker}} B^S_{y-1} \exp(-\beta^{\textrm{Ricker}} B^S_{y-1})\exp(\delta_y - 0.5 \tau^2) &amp; \textrm{if Ricker stock-recruit relationship}
\end{cases},
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\delta_y\)</span> are recruitment deviates and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the standard deviation of the deviates.</p>
<p>The spawning biomass is <span class="math inline">\(B^S_y\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[B^S_y = \sum_a w_{y,a} m_{y,a} N_{y,a},\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(m_{y,a}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_{y,a}\)</span> are the maturity at age and weight at age, respectively.</p>
