The term 'data-moderate' is used to reflect situations where sufficient data exists to apply quantitative models and obtain estimates (perhaps with wide levels of uncertainty) of the fishery dynamics. 

The [Rapid Conditioning Model](/tutorial-rcm/) has been developed to help condition OMs for data-limited and data-rich situations.  

The RCM is sufficiently flexible to be parameterized as full stock assessment model with various data weighting schemes and some time-varying dynamics explored, although the software is not intended to be used for stock assessment.

[Operating Models](/object-operating-model) conditioned with the RCM use the [Custom Parameters](/features-custom-parameters/) feature, and do not rely on the uniform ranges used for [Data-Limited OMs](/om-data-limited/).
