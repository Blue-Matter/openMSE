<p>To assist in documenting the rationale for the OM parameters, we recommended adding a short but informative description or rationale for the OM values in the RMarkdown file while the OM Excel file is being populated (open the RMarkdown file and edit with any text editor or RStudio).</p>
<p>You will see that the RMarkdown file has a series of headings (marked by #, ##, and ### for first, second and third level respectively) followed by some text, in this case default text is mainly instructions on how to fill the document.</p>
<p>The instruction text should be deleted and replaced with the relevant information for your operating model. For example, below the line “# Introduction” you would delete the instructions and provide a brief introduction to your fishery and the purpose of the OM and MSE.</p>
<p>It is important not to delete any of the headings.</p>
<p>After the Introduction section, the document has four first level headings corresponding to the Stock, Fleet, Obs and Imp components of the operating model.</p>
<p>Each section has a series of second level headings (e.g., ## M) which correspond to the slots of that object. In this example, the text below these headings indicates that this parameter was borrowed from another object (e.g ‘Borrowed from: Albacore’).</p>
<p>If the parameters in the OM workbook are modified from those borrowed from the existing object (in this case ‘Albacore’), you would delete this text and replace it will your own justification.</p>
<p>If you did not initialize your OM using existing objects as templates, it will say something like ‘No justification provided’.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to include the actual values in the justification text. The RMarkdown file containing the justifications/rationale will be compiled together with the OM Excel workbook containing the OM parameter values into a OM Report that contains both the justification text, the OM values, and a series of plots to visualize the OM parameters and properties.</p>
<p>The OM documentation file should be updated whenever values in the OM are changed.</p>
<p>Once complete, the <code>OMdoc</code> function can be used to compile the RMarkdown file into a HTML report and provides a complete documentation for the OM.</p>
<p>You can view more completed operating models and OM documentation reports in the <a href="/om-library">Operating Model Library</a>.</p>
