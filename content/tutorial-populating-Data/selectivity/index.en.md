There are five parameters relating to selectivity at length. Leave any entry blank if the parameter is unknown.

The *Selectivity* section in the Data Documentation file is indicated with "## Selectivity". Enter any relevant supporting information for the information in the Selectivity section of the input file here. 

Ideally a short paragraph or two with supporting information for data entered in the Data Input file for the selectivity parameters.

Use in-text citations where possible and include references under the "## Reference List" section.

Do not delete or modify the "## Selectivity" heading.

### Length at first capture
Numeric entries. 

The *Length at first capture* is an estimate of first length class that is vulnerable to the fishery (and the associated CV).

The example cobia data file assumes a length of first capture of 130 and a CV of 0.2.

### Length at full selection
Numeric entries. 

The *Length at full selection* is the first length class that is fully vulnerable to fishing (and the associated CV).

No information is available for the length at full selection for the example cobia data file.

### Vulnerability at asymptotic length
Numeric entry. 

The *Vulnerability at asymptotic length* describes that shape of the selectivity curve. Dome-shaped selectivity patterns (Vulnerability at asymptotic length < 1) occurs vulnerability to fishing begins to decrease after reaching a maximum value at some intermediate length.

The example cobia data file assumes asymptotic selectivity (Vulnerability at asymptotic length = 1).
