<h2>Delay Difference (DD_TMB) Model</h2>
<p>There has been a rich history of development for the delay difference model for catch and index data. For the formulation used in SAMtool, the most relevant citations are Chapter 9 of Hilborn and Walters (1992) and Carruthers et al. (2012).</p>
<div id="growth" class="section level3">
<h3>Growth</h3>
<p>Growth in weight-at-age <span class="math inline">\(w_a\)</span> follows the recursive Ford-Brody equation:
<span class="math display">\[w_a = \tilde\alpha + \rho w_{a-1}.\]</span>
We can obtain <span class="math inline">\(\tilde\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> for the delay difference model if weight is also described by the equation
<span class="math display">\[w_a = W_{\infty}(1 - \exp[K\{a-a_0\}])^b.\]</span>
Parameter <span class="math inline">\(\tilde\alpha\)</span> is solved in the limiting case where <span class="math inline">\(w_a = w_{a-1} = W_{\infty}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(a \rightarrow \infty\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[\tilde\alpha = W_{\infty}(1 - \rho). \]</span>
Substitution of equation 3 into equation 1 solves for <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[\rho = \dfrac{w_a - W_{\infty}}{w_{a-1} - W_{\infty}}.\]</span>
In SAMtool, <span class="math inline">\(a = k+2\)</span> is arbitrarily chosen to calculate <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the age of knife-edge selectivity. The age corresponding to the length of 50% maturity is chosen for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>

<h4>Beverton-Holt relationship</h4>
<p>With a Beverton-Holt stock recruit relationship, and spawning occurring before fishing in each annual time step, the recruitment (at age <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is:
<span class="math display">\[ R_t = \dfrac{\alpha B_{t-k}}{1 + \beta B_{t-k}},\]</span>

<p>Unfished recruitment <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> is an estimated parameter and steepness <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> can either be fixed or estimated. Unfished biomass <span class="math inline">\(B_0\)</span> is calculated as
<span class="math display">\[B_0 = R_0 \phi_0.\]</span>
The unfished biomass per recruit <span class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[\phi_0 = \dfrac{\tilde{\alpha} \exp(-M) + w_k (1 - \exp(-M))}{1 - \rho \exp(-M)}\]</span>

<h4>Ricker equation</h4>

<h2>Continuous Delay-Differential model (cDD)</h2>
<p>Compared to the discrete delay-difference (annual time-step in production and fishing), the delay-differential model (cDD) is based on continuous recruitment and fishing mortality within a time-step. The continuous model works much better for populations with high turnover (e.g. high F or M, continuous reproduction).</p>
<div id="growth-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Growth</h3>
<p>Growth in weight is modeled as a von Bertalanffy equation:
<span class="math display">\[ \dfrac{dw_{a,t}}{da} = \kappa (W_{\infty} - w_{a,t}).\]</span>
A solution to Equation 19 is
<span class="math display">\[w_{a+1,t} = W_{\infty} + (w_{a,t} - W_{\infty})\exp(-\kappa).\]</span>
From a mean weight-at-age schedule for ages <span class="math inline">\(a = k, k+1, \ldots\)</span>, a non-linear regression can be used to obtain <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="dynamics-equations-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Dynamics equations</h3>
<p>The governing equations for the pooled biomass <span class="math inline">\(B_t\)</span> and abundance <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> over time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> can be written as
<span class="math display">\[ \begin{align}
\dfrac{dN_t}{dt} &amp;= \dfrac{d}{dt} \int N_{a,t}da\\
\dfrac{dB_t}{dt} &amp;= \dfrac{d}{dt} \int w_{a,t}N_{a,t}da,
\end{align}\]</span>
where the integration is over ages <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>To evaluate the integral, we make substitutions based on the following:
<span class="math display">\[ \begin{align}
\dfrac{dN_{a,t}}{dt} &amp;= \dfrac{dN_{a,t}}{da}\dfrac{da}{dt} = -Z_t N_{a,t}\\
\dfrac{dw_{a,t}}{dt} &amp;= \dfrac{dw_{a,t}}{da}\dfrac{da}{dt} = \kappa (W_{\infty} - w_{a,t}). 
\end{align}\]</span>
After substitution and evaluation of the integrals, the governing equations are
<span class="math display">\[ \begin{align}
\dfrac{dN_t}{dt} &amp;= R_t - Z_t N_t\\
\dfrac{dB_t}{dt} &amp;= w_k R_t + \kappa W_{\infty} N_t - (Z_t + \kappa) B_t,
\end{align}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> is the abundance of recruits and <span class="math inline">\(w_k R_t\)</span> is the weight of recruits, both of which serve as the constants of integration describing the input of abundance and biomass, respectively, to the population.</p>
<p>Solving the differential equations 29 and 30 leads to the dynamics equations:
<span class="math display">\[ \begin{align}
N_{t+\Delta} &amp;= N_{\infty,t} + (N_t - N_{\infty,t})\exp(-Z_t\Delta)\\
B_{t+\Delta} &amp;= B_{\infty,t} + (N_t - N_{\infty,t}) \dfrac{\kappa W_{\infty}}{Z_t + \kappa} + \left[B_t - B_{\infty,t} - (N_t - N_{\infty,t}) \dfrac{\kappa W_{\infty}}{Z_t + \kappa}\right]\exp(-[Z_t+\kappa]\Delta),
\end{align}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Z_t = F_t + M\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N_{\infty,t} = R_t/Z_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_{\infty,t} = \dfrac{w_k + \dfrac{\kappa W_{\infty}}{Z_t}}{Z_t + \kappa}R_t\)</span> are the equilibrium abundance and biomass respectively, conditional on <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z_t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is the length of the time step, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = 1\)</span> for an annual time step.</p>
<p>With a constant and continuous fishing mortality rate <span class="math inline">\(F_t\)</span> over time step <span class="math inline">\(s = t\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(s = t + \Delta\)</span>, the accumulated catch in weight <span class="math inline">\(C_t\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
C_t &amp;= \int F_t B_s ds\\
&amp;= F_t\left[B_{\infty,t}\Delta + (N_t - N_{\infty,t}) \dfrac{\kappa W_{\infty}}{Z_t + \kappa} \Delta + \dfrac{B_t - B_{\infty,t} - (N_t - N_{\infty,t}) \dfrac{\kappa W_{\infty}}{Z_t + \kappa}[1 - \exp(-[Z_t+\kappa]\Delta)]}{Z_t + \kappa} \right]
\end{align}\]</span>
To match the predicted catch to the observed catch in the model, <span class="math inline">\(F_t\)</span> is solved iteratively using Newton’s method.</p>
<p>The predicted index for survey <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[\hat{I}_{s,t}=\hat{q}_s \hat{B}_{s,t}\]</span>
or
<span class="math display">\[\hat{I}_{s,t}=\hat{q}_s \hat{N}_{s,t}\]</span>
for a biomass and abundance-based index, respectively.</p>
<p>The likelihood of the observed index <span class="math inline">\(I_t\)</span>, using a lognormal distribution, is
<span class="math display">\[L^I = \sum_s \lambda_s \sum_t \left(-\log(\sigma_{s,t}) - 0.5\left[\dfrac{\log(I_{s,t}) - \log(\hat{I}_{s,t})}{\sigma_{s,t}}\right]^2\right),\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_s\)</span> is a weighting coefficient and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{s,t}\)</span> is the standard deviation of the index.</p>

<div id="stock-recruit-parameters-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Stock-recruit parameters</h3>
<p>The stock-recruit parameters are estimated in the same way as the delay difference model, except unfished abundance <span class="math inline">\(N_0\)</span> and biomass <span class="math inline">\(B_0\)</span> are calculated as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}

<h2>State-space version (DD_SS and cDD_SS)</h2>

<p>Log-recruitment deviations <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\delta}_t\)</span> are typically estimated as penalized parameters towards the likelihood, with the penalty:
