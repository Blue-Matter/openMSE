<h3>Dynamics equations</h3>
<p>The statistical catch-at-age model uses a time series of total catch (in weight), index, and catch-at-age observations, as well as information on weight, maturity, natural mortality at age.</p>
<p>The population abundance <span class="math inline">\(N_{a,t}\)</span> of age <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[ N_{a,t} =
\begin{cases}
      R_t &amp; a = 1\\
      N_{a-1,t-1} \exp(- v_{a-1} F_{t-1} - M_{a-1}) &amp; a = 2, \ldots, A-1\\
      N_{a-1,t-1} \exp(- v_{a-1} F_{t-1} - M_{a-1}) + N_{a,t-1} \exp(- v_a F_{t-1} - M_a) &amp; a = A
\end{cases},
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> is the recruitment (age-1), <span class="math inline">\(v_a\)</span> is the vulnerability at age <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F_t\)</span> is the apical fishing mortality rate, <span class="math inline">\(M_a\)</span> is the instantaneous natural mortality rate at age <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the maximum age in the model as a plus-group accumulator age.</p>
</div>
<div id="selectivity" class="section level3">
<h3>Selectivity</h3>
<p>Assuming logistic vulnerability, the vulnerability is:
<span class="math display">\[v_a = \left[1 + \exp\left(-\log(19) \dfrac{a - a_{50}}{a_{95} - a_{50}}\right)\right]^{-1}, \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(a_{50}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_{95}\)</span> are the estimated ages of 50% and 95% vulnerability, respectively.</p>
<p>Assuming dome vulnerability, a double Gaussian formulation is used:
<span class="math display">\[ v_a =
\begin{cases}
      f(a; a_{asc}, \sigma_{asc}) &amp; a \le a_{asc}\\
      1 &amp; a_{asc} \lt a \le a_{des}\\
      f(a; a_{des}, \sigma_{des}) &amp; a \gt a_{des}
\end{cases},
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(f(a; \mu, \sigma) = \exp(-0.5 (a - \mu)^2/\sigma^2)\)</span> is the normal probability density function scaled to one at <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Four parameters are estimated: <span class="math inline">\(a_{50}\)</span> the age of 50% vulnerability (ascending limb), <span class="math inline">\(a_{asc}\)</span> the first age of full vulnerability, <span class="math inline">\(a_{des}\)</span> the last age of full vulnerability, and <span class="math inline">\(v_A\)</span> the vulnerability at the maximum age in the model. The <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> for both the ascending and descending limbs of the double-normal equation are estimated parameters. From these four parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{asc} = \sqrt{(a_{50} - \mu_{asc})^2/\log(4)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{des} = \sqrt{-0.5(A - \mu_{des})^2/\log(v_A)}\)</span> can be derived. The default option sets <span class="math inline">\(a_{asc} = a_{des}\)</span>.</p>

<div id="biomass" class="section level3">
<h3>Biomass</h3>
<p>The vulnerable biomass <span class="math inline">\(VB_t\)</span> at the beginning of year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[VB_t = \sum_{a=1}^A v_a w_a N_{a,t},\]</span>
where weight-at-age <span class="math inline">\(w_a\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[w_a = W_{\infty}(1 - \exp[K\{a-a_0\}])^b.\]</span></p>
<p>The mature spawning biomass <span class="math inline">\(E_t\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[E_t = \sum_{a=1}^A m_a w_a N_{a,t},\]</span>

</div>
<div id="catch-at-age" class="section level3">
<h3>Catch-at-age</h3>
<p>The estimated catch-at-age <span class="math inline">\(\hat{C}_{a,t}\)</span> (CAA) is obtained from the Baranov equation:
<span class="math display">\[\hat{C}_{a,t} = \dfrac{\hat{v}_a \hat{F}_t}{\hat{v}_a \hat{F}_t + M_a} [1 - \exp(- \hat{v}_a \hat{F}_t - M_a)] \hat{N}_{a,t}.\]</span>
The predicted total catch in weight <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}_t\)</span> is
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}_t = \sum_a w_a \hat{C}_{a,t}.\)</span></p>
<p>The estimated index <span class="math inline">\(\hat{I}_t\)</span>, assuming that it is an index for total biomass, is
<span class="math display">\[ \hat{I}_t = \hat{q} \hat{B}_t,\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(B_t = \sum_{a=1}^A w_a N_{a,t}\)</span>. A function argument allows for the user to specify that the observed index is for vulnerable or spawning biomass.</p>
</div>
<div id="likelihoods" class="section level3">
<h3>Likelihoods</h3>
<p>The likelihood of the observed catch at age <span class="math inline">\(C_{a,t}\)</span>, assuming a multinomial distribution, is
<span class="math display">\[L^{CAA} = \sum_t O_t \sum_a p_{a,t} \log(\hat{p}_{a,t}),\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span> is the assumed sample size of catch-at-age observations in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{a,t} = \hat{C}_{a,t}/\sum_a\hat{C}_{a,t}\)</span> is annual predicted
proportions of catch-at-age.</p>
<p>If a lognormal distribution for the observed proportions at age is assumed, then the likelihood is
<span class="math display">\[L^{CAA} = \sum_t \left(-\log(0.01/\hat{p}_{a,t}) - 0.5\left[\dfrac{\log(p_{a,t}) - \log(\hat{p}_{a,t})}{0.01/\hat{p}_{a,t}}\right]^2\right)\]</span>.</p>
<p>The likelihood of the observed catch <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>, assuming a lognormal distribution, is
<span class="math display">\[L^Y = \sum_t \left(-\log(\omega) - 0.5\left[\dfrac{\log(Y_t) - \log(\hat{Y}_t)}{\omega}\right]^2\right).\]</span></p>
<p>The likelihood of the observed index <span class="math inline">\(I_t\)</span>, assuming a lognormal distribution, is
<span class="math display">\[L^I = \sum_t \left(-\log(\sigma) - 0.5\left[\dfrac{\log(I_t) - \log(\hat{I}_t)}{\sigma}\right]^2\right).\]</span></p>
<div id="sca-with-popes-approximation-sca_pope" class="section level4">
<h4>SCA with Pope’s approximation (SCA_Pope)</h4>
<p>A variant of the SCA is the <code>SCA_Pope</code> function, which fixes the predicted catches to the observed catches and uses Pope’s approximation to calculate the annual harvest rate in the midpoint of the year.</p>
<p>The abundance at age is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ N_{a,t} =
\begin{cases}
      R_t &amp; a = 1\\
      N_{a-1,t-1} (1 - v_{a-1} u_{t-1}) \exp(-M_{a-1}) &amp; a = 2, \ldots, A-1\\
      N_{a-1,t-1} (1 - v_{a-1} u_{t-1}) \exp(-M_{a-1}) + N_{a,t-1} (1 - v_a u_{t-1}) \exp(-M_a) &amp; a = A

<p>The vulnerable biomass in the midpoint of the year is
<span class="math display">\[VB^{mid}_t = \sum_{a=1}^A v_a w_a N_{a,t} \exp(-0.5 M_a).\]</span></p>
<p>By conditioning the model on catch in weight <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>, the estimated annual harvest rate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{u}_t\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[\hat{u}_t = Y_t / \widehat{VB^{mid}}_t .\]</span>
The estimated catch at age <span class="math inline">\(\hat{C}_{a,t}\)</span> is

<div id="estimation-of-recruitment-and-reference-points" class="section level3">
<h3>Estimation of recruitment and reference points</h3>
<p>There are two variants of the statistical catch-at-age model for estimation of recruitment and reference points. In function <code>SCA</code>, productivity parameters <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> are estimated in the assessment model. Annual recruitment is estimated as deviations from the resulting stock-recruitment relationship within the model. MSY reference points are derived from the estimates of <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p>
<p>In <code>SCA2</code>, no stock-recruit relationship is assumed in the assessment model, i.e., annual recruitment is estimated as deviations from the mean recruitment over the observed time series, similar to Cadigan (2016). After the assessment, a stock-recruit function can be fitted post-hoc to the recruitment and spawning stock biomass estimates from the assessment model to obtain MSY reference points.</p>
