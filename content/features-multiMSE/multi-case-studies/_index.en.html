<h4><a href="/multi-MSE/Framework_Manual.pdf"> Evaluating Single-Species Assessment and Management of Multi-Species Fisheries </a></h4>
<p>This document describes the application of openMSE’s multi-MSE features to evaluate the performance of alternative management options for multispecies fisheries that are
managed assuming a single stock. It uses the blue-deacon fishery managed by the <a href="https://www.pcouncil.org/">Pacific Fishery Management Council</a> as a case study, and implements the PFMC’s P* uncertainty buffer approach in a series of management procedures.</p>
